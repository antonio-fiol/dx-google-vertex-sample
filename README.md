This project contains the source code and build for a sample AI integration for DX for WCM following the model established in https://help.hcl-software.com/digital-experience/9.5/latest/get_started/plan_deployment/traditional_deployment/wcm_env/wcm_ai_analysis/#custom-configurations-for-ai-analysis.

It leverages Google Vertex AI (see: https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai ) for sentiment analysis, summary and keyword generation.

The build of the project is established via maven.

## Code Adjustment

Adjust the following for your project and region:
```
	private static final String PROJECT = "your-project-id-google";
	private static final String LOCATION = "us-central1";
```

## Deployment

Use mvn package and copy the resulting jar file to the DX shared library - e.g. on a container to /opt/HCL/wp_profile/PortalServer/sharedLibrary.
Also include any required jar files - e.g. for the google maven dependency. 
Not sure how to get those? A command like mvn dependency:copy-dependencies will download all the dependent jar files to the target/dependency directory.


Generate a service account key and export the key to DX.
